# friend
Java clone of "Neko" from PC-98

## Linux support
Linux support is poor. Due to issues with Java on Linux and transparent windows, the animations leave afterimages. A workaround is to run the program with

```
java -jar friend.jar -linux
```

Which draws a white background.

Or, alternatively just:

```
sudo apt-get install oneko
oneko
```

Which installs a better version made by someone else.
